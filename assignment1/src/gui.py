# Grid GUI
# 
# Takes in a grid object that exposes a get(x,y) or possibly __index__()
# and displays it
# 
# Also produces events via handlers for clicks on grid locations and new grid
# events
# Something like register_click(click_handler) and register_new(reset_handler)
# where click_handler receives (x,y) coordinates and the reset_handler receives
# the size of the new grid

# We don't have to implement the click handlers for assignment 1 but we might for others.
